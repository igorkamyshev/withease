/*
 * The reason for the following types is that by default TypeScript does not
 * support overloaded functions in generics â€” https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14107
 *
 * But we need to support overloads in `invoke` function because it is used in
 * many factories in Effector's ecosystem and we don't want to break them.
 *
 * The following types are adapted from the following comment:
 * https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14107#issuecomment-1146738780
 *
 * Changes from the original implementation:
 * 1. OverloadReturn were changed because the original implementation does not infer
 * exact return type but do infer union of all possible return types.
 * 2. OverloadReturn supports only single-agrument functions because @withease/factories
 * does not support multiple arguments in general.
