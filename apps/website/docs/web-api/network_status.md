# Network status

Allows tracking network status with [_Events_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) and [_Stores_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store).

::: info

Uses [Navigator.onLine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine), [Window: online event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event) and [Window: offline event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event) under the hood

:::

## Usage

All you need to do is to create an integration by calling `trackNetworkStatus` with an integration options:

- `setup`: after this [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) all listeners will be installed, and the integration will be ready to use; it is required because it is better to use [explicit initialization _Event_ in the application](/magazine/explicit_start).
- `teardown?`: after this [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) all listeners will be removed, and the integration will be ready to be destroyed.

```ts
import { trackNetworkStatus } from '@withease/web-api';

const { online, offline, $online, $offline } = trackNetworkStatus({
  setup: appStarted,
});
```

Returns an object with:

- `online`: [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) that fires on connection restore
- `offline`: [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) that fires on connection loss
- `$online`: [_Store_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) with `true` if connection is restored and `false` if connection is lost
- `$offline`: [_Store_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/store) with `true` if connection is lost and `false` if connection is restored

::: tip
It supports [`@@trigger` protocol](/protocols/trigger). Since it allows firing only one [_Event_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/event) `trackNetworkStatus` triggers `online` as a `fired` in case of [`@@trigger` protocol](/protocols/trigger).

```ts
import { trackNetworkStatus } from '@withease/web-api';

somethingExpectsTrigger(trackNetworkStatus);
```
