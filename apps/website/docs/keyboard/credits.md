This library inspired by two open source projects:

- https://github.com/Kelin2025/effector-hotkey
- https://github.com/xnimorz/on-hotkey

We are grateful to the authors of these libraries for their work. The key differences between them and `@withease/keyboard` are:

- [effector-hotkey](https://github.com/xnimorz/on-hotkey) does not support Fork API and can not be used with [_Scope_](https://effector.dev/docs/api/effector/scope). All `@withease/*` libraries are designed to be compatible with Fork API, as well as `@withease/keyboard`.

- [on-hotkey](https://github.com/xnimorz/on-hotkey) provides only plain JavaScript API, to use it with Effector you need to write some boilerplate code. All `@withease/*` libraries are designed to be used in Effector-based applications, as well as `@withease/keyboard`.
